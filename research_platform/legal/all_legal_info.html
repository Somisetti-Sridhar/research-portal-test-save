Overview
The Research Portal is a student-developed, open-source academic platform created to facilitate research sharing and academic collaboration. It is strictly non-commercial and developed using open-source technologies. The platform provides an accessible environment for students, researchers, and educators to upload, explore, and collaborate on academic research content. It is built with privacy, transparency, and educational integrity at its core, and all functionality is designed with privacy-by-design principles.

Purpose and Mission
The platform is intended solely for educational and academic purposes. It supports the ethical sharing of research materials and promotes open access to scholarly content. The mission is to enhance academic collaboration while safeguarding user data and respecting research integrity.

Platform Ownership
The Research Portal is maintained by independent student developers. The primary developer and point of contact is Sridhar Somisetti at sridharsomisettiwork@gmail.com. Co-developers include Sairam Maruri at sairam.maruri@gmail.com, and Ram Charan Barma at ramcharanbarma99@gmail.com. All contributors are committed to maintaining user privacy and ensuring data security in line with best practices.

Data Collection and Use
User accounts may include data such as email addresses, usernames, affiliations, and optional profile information. This data is collected solely for authentication and academic networking purposes. User consent is required for data collection, and retention is limited to the active duration of the account plus one year. Users may upload research papers along with associated metadata and version history. This data is used to support academic sharing and collaboration. Ownership and control of uploaded content remain with the user, and such data is retained permanently unless removed by the user. AI-powered features on the platform utilize anonymized search queries and behavioral data to improve recommendation systems and interface functionality. If a user is using this platform, they have given consent.

Data Protection and Security
The platform employs modern technical and organizational security measures. HTTPS is enforced across the entire website, and passwords are securely hashed. Access to administrative functionality is role-restricted. Encrypted storage is used for all documents. Code reviews are conducted regularly to ensure compliance with privacy standards.

Privacy Principles
The platform adheres to several core privacy principles. All data is used solely for educational purposes. No personal data is exploited for commercial gain or advertising.

International and National Compliance
The platform follows relevant international and national data protection frameworks. It is designed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 of India. Users have access to their personal data and may correct or delete their information where applicable. As an open-source, student-maintained academic platform, the system does not provide formal mechanisms for raising legal disputes or initiating cross-border data complaints. By using the platform, users acknowledge that it is non-commercial, community-driven, and does not offer structured legal support channels.

Third-Party Services and Infrastructure

All software tools and libraries used in development are retained under their original licenses. The platform codebase, including all enhancements, is released under the Apache License 2.0 to ensure transparency and encourage community development.
